<h3>How do I feel ?</h3>
<p>I am about to be 22 years old as of today , 28th September 2025 ,and I have never been consistent with anything. I , sure have tried a lot of things , but have never continued with any , one thing . It feels like , my attention span has become really short and I just become anxious when I am not on social media .
My health has deteriorated , my learning capabilities have decreased and am here , just wasting days , doing pretty much nothing .</p>
<p>I am just sad , because , I'm not able to do the things I want to do . I'm just sad by the surrounding environment I'm in. This world is just so inhumane . I guess , I'm a little naive person and want to see / touch upon the naivety in people , but I just constantly get stabbed with the amount of greed , lust , selfishness , jealousy and hatred that's present.</p>
<p>Over here , I'm not even talking about the people on different social media platforms , they are just the lowest level . Even at my college , offline , I see , meet and talk to people , who are just purely greedy and selfish . Consequently , their view of other people is also very narrow .</p>
<p>I just wish to value each consciousness equally , be it a woman , a greedy person , a selfish person or anyone else . I don't believe that their soul / consciousness has these attributes . My own girlfriend faced a lot of tough things in her childhood and she just gave up on giving people a chance to show , how human they are .</p>
<p>It deeply hurts me</p>
<h3>What to do ?</h3>
<p>But now , I have to change . I will keep my empathy , my wish to value consciousness equally really close to my heart . It will be something that will always stay in my character . But I need to be tough , for my own good .</p>
<p>I'll have to start saying more NO's . Even if I someday wish to build to something , someday , that could help more people . I have to build myself now , so that I can someday , do good for others . The kindness that I have , I'll keep that close to my heart and only reveal when necessary.</p>
<p>What I have to do , is to keep my head down , keep learning for myself continuously , 24 x 7. I will keep these blogs as some third person's way into knowing about my heart . It will be difficult to find me this way , but then that's how the deserving ones only , will find me.</p>
<h3>What do I aim for ?</h3>
<p>I want to learn , a lot of things . Maybe .... that's a pretty big downside for me
I have definitely come to the harsh truth , that I can't have it all , of course . But I will still try to learn things as I go , as much as I can .</p>
<p>The only thing , I will keep in my mind is to enjoy everything that I do</p>
<p>Well ..... then what are the things I aim for ? I'll keep that to myself</p>
