<p>It is the first time , I have had this experience working with a team of people and I feel eerily proud of it. Even though , I feel I could have put in more efforts from my end , in an attempt to make things smoother , but I still feel a sense of peace in the work I did .</p>
<p>It feels eerie because I still have the same thought in my mind that , I could have done more , but yet , I feel different about it , in the sense that I put in an effort towards compensating for the times I missed , that I could have given to competitive programming .</p>
<p>Me , being a little more mature than I was 4 years ago , am able to cherish this moment of growth that I'm have gone through . This , in itself , is a moment of joy for me , that I'll remember forever . I have met people , who are incredibly good , honest and hardworking . It makes me rethink , do I really want to be famous , rich and &quot; successful &quot; or not ?</p>
<p>I think , good hardworking people don't get famous almost always . It is just the few lucky chosen ones who get a name in the history books . A lot of men and women just live their lives and pass away. They have no &quot; optimisation &quot; to make in their lives . Optimisations like , earn more to get a better house , better health , better partner , better food and healthier , more educated kids . They just exist with their pure hearts , ( or maybe bad hearts too ) , but they live for completely different reasons .</p>
<p>Taking my own college life . My circle revolves around , getting into the best role for quantitative finance , be it a researcher or a developer. Honestly , my entire 4 years worth of journey just went there . With the rise of LLMs  , the assignments in my college , did not necessarily mean much . On the other hand , a lot of people did lead more fulfilling lives and did something that meant a lot for them , which will lead to a good pay in the long future . It is definitely something to explore the tradeoff between a successful life and a fulfilling one . One can definitely get both , but can it is frowned upon !</p>
