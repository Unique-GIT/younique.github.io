<p>For a long time , I have thought , that I haven't really done anything in my life , where my girlfriend thinks that I am just under appreciating myself . Well , let's just bluntly list down things and see where do I stand .</p>
<p>By the way , I'm 21 years old , as of now</p>
<h4>Why do I feel , I haven't done anything / Regret the life I have lead ?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anime / gaming / movie FOMO</p>
<ul>
<li>I have missed out on the movies , animes people over here have watched , the games people have played in their childhood .</li>
<li>By games , I'm referring to mobile games. I just don't share their nostalgia with them.</li>
<li>When they talk about it , it feels like a shared experience they had , which I somehow missed upon .</li>
<li>I didn't play a single game , watched a single movie ( I do watch movies , just not the more famous ones which they have a shared experience with) , no webseries ( although I did watch a few recently , but they are just very specific of my interests , which are very different from others )</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Books , books ......books - I haven't read a single book</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of really smart people in my school participated in all sorts of olympiads and even after seeing them as well as being interested in the math , I never participated or committed to it .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FRIENDS X||||| :</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of people around me , had friends from their childhood . I felt lost for a long time. Like , I was in a different world entirely . It was only in my 8th standard , that I felt &quot;born&quot; and I started talking to people.</li>
<li>I don't have any significant memories before that</li>
<li>The memories before that :
<ul>
<li>Being bullied</li>
<li>Embarrassing moments of silence in front of the entire class</li>
<li>being called fat</li>
<li>being called chubby</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I said to a girl - &quot; I like you&quot; , when I was infatuating and I just ignored her very hard until 4 years laters , when I apologized for how I treated her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I asked another girl out for a date and I was rejected hard . I just said &quot; I respect that choice , thanks &quot; , and that was it .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well , the last two points about asking someone out , doesn't point towards my lack of interaction with the girls at my school , I had a couple of good friends . It was just my stupid attempt at asking out , where I haven't thought through anything or really given a thought to it . I just feel embarrassed even today , at what I did . I still feel embarrassed , not necessarily sad , but just embarrassed .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't even blame her , she might also have been in the same state of confusion . I don't know , it's just that until I meet her again someday and she says it's okay , I will continue to have random moments of remembrance and embarrassments .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have felt a pretty long time , that I am ugly . Maybe , I will be working on improving my life,  and feel good in the process of doing so</p>
<p>Majority of problems in my life , have been around a commitment issue . I just never stayed consistent with anything.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are the things , I have actually done ?</h4>
<ul>
<li>I play chess , am 1700 in rapid as of now , wish to learn even more so in the future</li>
<li>I prepared two years for JEE Advanced , did it very recklessly and was able to get a general rank of AIR 2400 - ish . It was a good result , but I just prepared very recklessly</li>
<li>I learnt Indian classical music for 3 years but wasn't a part of choir at my school , so nobody shares that experience . Also , I just stopped learning music abruptly , like , I just stopped . Without a fair reason . Another instance of me , not at all being consistent</li>
<li>I'm fairly good at academics and have recently been very much interested in pursuing the field of computer Science and be the best Engineeer out there .</li>
</ul>
