<p>This is the very first blog I'm writing , and , it's about me !
I am Aakash Shankar and at this very moment , I realise , I don't know a lot of things about myself . I started programming in my college and just tried to tinker around stuff ,try things that put me in an uncomfortable position while my batchmates , with the best resumes, best personalities and great projects in their &quot;experiences&quot; were out , getting the best internships and jobs.</p>
<p>I have been exploring development for a while . I ,  very recently ( as of July 2025 ) interned at a startup for developing low latency C++ applications  which was fun and ,  luckily had really good people there .
But , given the awkward personality that I have ,  combined with the lack of good projects , I have decided to code my own website entirely from scratch. Programming everysingle piece on my own , as needed . This website will be a place where I will put my life , not necessarily for some one to notice , but just for myself .</p>
<p>A little context for who I am as a person . I have been shaped by the people that I have in my life. I see my parents as humans who put a lot of effort , to make decisions while being torn apart by conflicting choices and still trying to be &quot;good parents&quot; . I appreciate that effort . I think I have inherited their courage . The other person that has a lot of influence on me is my girlfriend . She is like a soldier , just marching through her problems , head-on , relentlessly. It's a little frightening for me , how does she just march through everything . I take little time to process , but she just moves ahead , which I find fascinating.</p>
<p>As a result of that , I am becoming a person conflicted between my choices, trying to meet my expectations from myself but still marching through my problems one at a time . I don't know , if this combination is good or bad , but it has helped become a better person than who I was.</p>
<p>Also , I have a great set of honest friends who value good people , so there could have nothing better than them</p>
<p>As far as the blogs are concerned  , I want to document this journey of building this website as well as everything that I wish to do in my life .</p>
