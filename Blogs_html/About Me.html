<p>Hey ! I am Aakash Shankar and I love to wander around . It is ironic of me to describe myself as a wanderer , because I am not an avid reader and haven't explored movies , anime , mobile games , pc games , or  literally anything as much as my peers have . ( Even though they keep asking me to follow them , but I'll watch them when I find the time to do so )</p>
<p>But I still like to call myself a wanderer and it's because I have been wandering around since I realised I was born . Yes ! I feel, to this day , that I was born in my 8th standard / grade / class as a 14 year old . I had a very plain and simple life before that and I don't remember much of it , except , maybe a few bad memories that keep me haunted by just popping up in my head once in a while .</p>
<h2>My Dilemma</h2>
<p>There's another reason I call myself a wanderer . It is because , I feel , that I'm kinder than the people around me and am kind of a &quot;carrying my heart on my sleeve&quot; kind of a guy . I don't hide and am blunt . Now , these personality traits in a human being , ladies and gentleman , is what is referred to as the traits of a &quot;naive&quot; person .</p>
<p>A &quot;naive&quot; person , who makes you feel good , who is a nice company to have , a person whose smile seems to be adorable and is also someone who you wish well for .
But , that same person , is &quot;too optimistic&quot; , &quot; is blind to the ways of the world &quot; , is seen as someone not so ambitious , someone cute but not sexy , as someone you want to be around you , but not someone you want to be like.
( Saying this , because I come from a competitive environment and I see people &quot;consuming&quot; others around me to get ahead , to literally get all the good habits/traits/things from the other person ) .</p>
<p>A &quot;naive&quot; person , does irrational things hoping for things to turn out good . With proper execution , a lot of times things do turn out well , but sometimes they don't .</p>
<h2>My problems</h2>
<h3>First things first</h3>
<p>Well , first things first , I am not very disciplined right now , in terms of my lifestyle and I am working on building myself inside out . That's the first thing on top of my mind .</p>
<h3>Things I want to try</h3>
<p>Second , in terms of the things I want to do , I do wish to pursue music again at some point of time in my life . I trained in Indian classical music for a couple of years and I yearn to get back on that. Apart from that I play chess which I also wish to continue playing .
I do want to get fit . I am physically , an unhealthy amount of inactive . Well , these are the things I have tried somewhat .
Apart from them , I do wish to keep reading as a habit , reading fiction in particular .
And ohh , cooking for myself is definitely something that I'm looking forward to.</p>
<p>This is also something of a problem , as I have &quot;too many things on my plate&quot; to try and it's not a good idea , in this era of hyper-specialised world to be trying many things out.</p>
<h3>Meaning ??</h3>
<p>Well , people around me try to look meaning in the &quot;things&quot; they come across and I just don't ! I am more intrigued by the people I meet in doing / knowing those &quot;things&quot; and the stories they carry .</p>
<h4>Special things ....</h4>
<p>I am in awe of a &quot;thing&quot; , not because of the &quot;thing&quot; itself but because of the thought behind it , the knower  , the doer that came up with that &quot;thing&quot;. The sheer audacity of that person to make that &quot;thing&quot; special is the real fascination .</p>
<p>It's like saying , &quot; It's only when you lose someone , you realise , they were just an ordinary person , it's your thought that made them special ! &quot;.</p>
<p>Just as in chess, you get all excited about an idea that's pretty mundane and doesn't even carry any meaning for somebody who doesn't follow chess , but it's the meaning the chess players , chess followers and chess fans give , it's the heart that you pour out that makes the idea special.</p>
<h3>Also , what meaning ??</h3>
<p>Now , that its established that I am &quot;naive&quot; , I will also clarify that I don't necessarily need any meaning / purpose to do something .</p>
<p>Just as Immanuel Kant said , I like to treat people and most things , as &quot;ends&quot; themselves rather than them being a &quot;means&quot; to something else . In this world , where everybody is working towards living an optimised life ( another romantic way of saying , a selfish life ) , you only do those things that give you something , meet those people that give something back to you .</p>
<p>And , apparently , this is also a &quot;problem&quot; for me , and I have to find my way around this .</p>
<h2>What's next ....</h2>
<p>I have had a different life than all the people I have met , and I will continue to keep that &quot;naive&quot; child inside me . But I will definitely put an acceleration to the hard work and the selfishness/ cleverness that's needed to live . That &quot;naive&quot; child is stupid and courageous at the same time , so it will help me take bigger decisions as and when needed</p>
